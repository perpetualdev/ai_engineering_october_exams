1. Approach from Data Cleaning to Model Deployment

Data Ingestion/Cleaning (PDA)
- The main objective is to build a prediction model from our white wine data using measurements such as sulphides, acidity, alcohol and other wine chemical qualities to predict the quality of the wine.
- Downloaded and loaded the dataset viewing to confirm that data is present
- Checked for missing values to avoid messiness in the data before preprocessing. No missing values present in our wine dataset.
- Checked for duplicate values and handle them appropriately 
- Verified data types. All the data types are numerical including the target (quality) which is appropriate to measure the quality of the data. No need to correct them.
- Also checked for the basic information of the data and the descriptive summary (checking the distribution, range, etc)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This is usually done to analyze the dataset to see what features needs to be added if necessary and check the relationships between features to prepare for preprocessing
- Univariate Analysis:
  This is to check each feature to find out if there are outliers in the data and if we need to handle them during preprocessing. Also checking how normalized, skewed our data is (normal distribution)

  Using histogram and boxplot for visualization, noticed there are a number of outliers in all our features apart from alcohol that has no outlier and little outliers in quality.

  Also noticed, most of the features are postiviely skewed (skewed to the right) and need to be normalized

- Bivariate Analysis:
  This is to check the relationship between two features. We were able to analyse each feature with the target using correlation heatmap.

  From the map, we can see that there is a high influence/correlation of alcohol, sulphates and chlorides with the quality of the wine (target).

Categorize the Target for splitting
  - Encoding the data set by mapping the quality to different classes (3 & 4 - Bad, 5 - Average, 6 & 7 - Good, 8 & 9 - Best) preparing it for data splitting

Split the Dataset into Target (y) and features (X)
  The features were splitted into X (wine features used to predict) and y (target/outcome/predicted value).

Scale the features using MinMaxScaler:
 To give the features a range between 0 and 1, we used MinMaxScaler to scale, fit and transform to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model for maximum performance.

Build Classification Model:
  - Split our dataset into training and testing sets using the 80%/20% test size for training and testing respectively. As the size of our dataset fall within the range of a few thousands.

  - Using Logistic Regression algorithm which is best for linear models and a dataset of this size to train our wine prediction model.

  - Created a confusion matrix for classification report to understand the percentage/fraction of prediction, recall/sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. This will let us know how well the model can predict.

Compared Multiple models
It is best to run our model through multiple models to choose the best model using classification metrics such as prediction, recall, f1-score and accuracy.

Used classifiers such as RandomForest, DecisionTree, KNeighbors and GaussianNB to train our model. Chose the best model (RandomForest) based on the metrics listed above.

- Optimize the model using Hyperparameter tuning (using parameters to optimize the performance/precision of the model).
  Used RandomizedSearchCV as this is computationally cheap and selects random parameters.

Finally, saved the model and scalar to create API

- Model Deployment
Using our saved model and scalar, created a simple prediction API that takes in the wine features and returns the quality of the wine (Bad, Average, Good, etc.)
